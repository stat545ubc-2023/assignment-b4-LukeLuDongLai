# Option A – Strings and Functional Programming in R
## Overview
This repository has been created for Assignment B-4 of STAT 545B, where I have completed Exercise 1 & 2 for **Option A – Strings and functional programming in R**.

## Contents
- Exercise 1: Text analysis using the janeaustenr package. This exercise includes loading a book, preprocessing the text, removing stopwords, and visualizing the most common words.
- Exercise 2: Creation of a custom function named reverse_pig_latin, which demonstrates string manipulation based on specified rules. This exercise includes function definition, implementation, examples, and tests.

## Usage
1. Viewing Results: You can directly open the Markdown (.md) file included in this repository to view the results and outputs of the code execution.
2. Running the Code: Open the R Markdown file (.Rmd) in an R environment and run the code blocks sequentially. Ensure that the required R packages (janeaustenr, tidytext, dplyr, stringr, purrr, ggplot2, testthat) are installed.
